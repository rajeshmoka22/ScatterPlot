Hi!
If you need my help at anytime, feel free to reach out on Twitter, @ohansemmanuel. 

It may take sometime to get to your message, but I will definitely reply you! 

Also, some other bundles (available on the book site, https://TheReduxJSBooks.com) come with a private Slack channel where you can ask me any questions at all. In real time. 

If that interests you, please check the website, https://TheReduxJSBooks.com
